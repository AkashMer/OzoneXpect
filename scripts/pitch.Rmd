## **Introduction**

**[OzoneXpect](http://akashmer.shinyapps.io/OzoneXpect)** aims to **predict mean Ozone levels in parts per billion(ppb)** based on the measurement taken or the information known by the user.  
The user is allowed to input the following information :
  
1. **Measurement taken/information known to the user** - Represented as a predictor in the app, user can choose from the following,
    + **Temperature***(default)*
    + **Wind speed**
    + **Solar Radiation**
2. **Current Month** - Month the above measurement was taken in. Also gives the option to not specify the month. User can choose from **May to September** or **Any Month***(default)*
3. **Measurement Value** - User can then enter the measurement value to be used for the prediction.
  
**Data Used** - The data for the app comes from the `airquality` data set in R `datasets` package which is as follows,
```{r loadData, echo=TRUE, cache=TRUE, comment=""}
str(airquality)
```
**`r 100 - round(mean(complete.cases(airquality))*100, 2)`% of rows** contain missing values. `impute.knn()` function from the `impute` package was used to impute these mmissing values

## **How does it predict?**

**[OzoneXpect](http://akashmer.shinyapps.io/OzoneXpect)** predicts using 2 different models,
  
1. **Linear Model** - A linear model is built using the desired predictor as the outcome and using the data from the `airquality` data set. The data is subsetted in case a particular month was selected to ensure stratification and avoid any confounding due to the *month* variable. This model is built using the `lm()` function in R.
2. **Loess Model** - A non-linear model is built under the same circumstances as above. This model is built using the `loess()` function in R with a **span of 0.7**
  
Then, the mean ozone level is predicted using both models and returned with a 95% prediction interval for both models  

## **Outputs**
  
### **1. Relationship Plot**

Salient Features : 
  
* An interactive scatter plot between ozone and the desired predictor is displayed as soon as any **predictor and month is selected and changes based on the changes in those 2 inputs**.
* **Lines representing both the models** are also included with the option to click and select which one appears left to the user
* Once the measurement input is done, the plot is updated with the prediction points plotted as well

### **2. Predictions**

Salient Features :
  
* A table is displayed to the user **only if the input values are within the corresponding bounds of minimum and maximum values** in the `airquality` data set to ensure higher accuracy.
* Any **negative values taken by the prediction or the 95% prediction interval bounds are highlighted with orange** to inform the user that these values are incorrect.
  
```{r examplePrediction, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, dependson="examplePlot"}
if(system.file(package = "gt") == "") install.packages("gt")
library(gt)

# Predicting om the linear model
ozoneLinear <- predict(modelLinear, newdata = valueDat,
                                   interval = "prediction")

# Predicting on the loess model
predLoess <- predict(modelLoess, newdata = valueDat, se = TRUE)
ozoneLoess  <- data.frame(predLoess$fit,
                          predLoess$fit - predLoess$se.fit,
                          predLoess$fit + predLoess$se.fit)
            
# Combining the predictions into a single data framw
result <- data.frame(ozone=c(ozoneLinear[1,1], ozoneLoess[1,1]),
                     lower=c(ozoneLinear[1,2], ozoneLoess[1,2]),
                     upper=c(ozoneLinear[1,3], ozoneLoess[1,3]))
            
# Creating a gt table object for printing
tab <- gt(result) %>%
    tab_header(
        title = md("**Example Prediction**")) %>%
        tab_spanner(
        label = md("**95% Prediction Interval**"),
        columns = c("lower", "upper")
    ) %>%
    cols_label(
        ozone = md("**Mean Ozone Level(ppb)**"),
        lower = md("*lower limit*"),
        upper = md("*upper limit*")
    ) %>%
    tab_row_group(
        label = md("**Loess Model**"),
        rows = 2
    ) %>%
    tab_row_group(
        label = md("**Linear Model**"),
        rows = 1
    ) %>%
    tab_style(
        style = cell_fill(color = "orange", alpha = 0.5),
        locations = cells_body(columns = everything(),
                               rows = ozone < 0 |
                                   lower < 0 |
                                   upper < 0)
    ) %>%
    tab_footnote(
        footnote = md("*These negative values are not helpful*"),
        locations = cells_body(columns = everything(),
                               rows = ozone < 0 |
                                   lower < 0 |
                                   upper < 0)
    ) %>%
    tab_source_note(
    source_note = md("*Reference: airquality data set from R 
                     datasets package*")
    )

# Returning the table
tab
```

## **Strengths**
  
1. The user is **afforded a lot of input options** like deciding the predictor, informing the app about the current month, and thus is able to **get mean ozone levels depending on a variety of conditions**.
2. An **interactive** plot is displayed which **updates depending on the user's input**
3. **Both linear and non-linear predictions are returned**, thus allowing the user to choose whatever predictions they want
4. User is **informed about incorrect predictions as well**
5. Predictions are coupled with **95% prediction intervals** thus providing the probability statistic behind the uncertainty in the predictions
  
### *Limitations and Plans to tackle the limitations*
  
1. Small data set - In search for larger data sets representing similar variables
2. Only 6/12 months included - In search for data sets containing measurements for around the year
3. Data was not divided into train/test sets due to the already small sample size - Prediction intervals and the associated probability of error is provided though
